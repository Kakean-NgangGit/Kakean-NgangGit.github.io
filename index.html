                        &emsp; Indonesia began its process of independence in 1945.
                        During the Battle of Surabaya (one of the most important battles on its path to emancipation),
                        British troops captured a rare example of a "Tankette" used by Indonesian fighters.
                        The vehicle was based on a <strong>Universal Carrier</strong> modified by adding a layered deck on which a turret of possibly Japanese origin was mounted.
                        Though we still don't know more about the responsibility for its authorship, total amounts, nor its technical details.

                            &emsp; Present-day Indonesia was a Dutch colony from the 18th century until 1949.
                            This colony has had its own armed forces since 1814,
                            the <strong>Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</strong> or better known by its initials <strong>KNIL (Koninklijke Nederlandsch Indische Leger)</strong>.
                            These froces consisted of European personnel and levies from the native population.
                            The KNIL carried out the function of maintaining the security and defense of the colonial territory,
                            although for most of its history the KNIL had to suppress rebellions that were continuously carried out by the Indonesian population who were unwilling to accept Dutch domination.

                        &emsp; In 1936, this body began a process of expansion on modernization and mechanization, 
                        but the beginning of the world conflict surprised them without letting to finished it.
                        Japan longed to have access to the oil, rubber and quinine produced in Netherlands East Indies,
                        which is why they considered its occupation as one of its strategic objectives.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The Japanese advance through the different Asian territories and reached the Netherlands East Indies in December 1941 until March 1942,
                        just three months later, they ended the invasion.
                        Part of the reasons for this easy victory was the lack of preparation of the Dutch forces and the failure to receive support from the metropolis that was occupied by the Germans.
                        This apparent weakness stimulated the Indonesian nationalist movement, clearly evident since 1929.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Once the invasion phase was over, the Japanese high command reduced the quantity and quality of Japanese forces in Java, Sumatra and Borneo.
                        These troops had the mission of controlling the primary territory and, secondarily, because they were only assigned to least probable defense against outside attacks. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; To reinforce the Japanese presence, the Japanese authorities took all the measures within their reach.
                        On the material side, they put back into use some of the Allied material captured in the recent campaign.
                        In this sense, those KNIL vehicles that were considered useful and were still operational were put into service,
                        such as the <strong>Marmon-Herrington combat light tanks</strong> or the <strong>Vickers Carden Lloyd light tanks</strong> (there is no exact data on their number, but they ranged between 17 and 44 examples of armored vehicles captured according to Dutch or Japanese sources).
                        It is also believed that they brought <strong>Bren Carriers</strong> or <strong>Universal Carriers</strong> captured after the capture of Malaya and Singapore.

                        &emsp; For the same purpose, a way was sought to increase human resources through the creation of auxiliary military and police units,
                        made up of the indigenous population, for which the organization <strong>PETA ( Pembela Tanah Air / Defenders of the Homeland)</strong> was founded.
                        This organization trained young Indonesians with the aim of using them as guerrilla forces destined to act behind enemy lines in the hypothetical case of an allied invasion.
                        These troops will be decisive in the future by becoming the nucleus of regular forces that will form the future Indonesian Armed Forces in 1945.

                        &emsp; The Japanese also encouraged the Indonesian nationalist movement with the goal of creating a puppet state.
                        They dismantled the structures of the Dutch Administration and supported the creation of Indonesian institutions that would allow them to carry out their ("guarded") emancipation.

                        &emsp; When Japan's surrender occurred on <strong>15th August 1945</strong>, fighting had barely taken place in the territory of the former Netherlands East Indies.
                        The Japanese occupation troops found themselves in a contradictory situation.
                        One of the conditions of the surrender required them to hand over weapons, but on the other hand, until the arrival of allied forces, they were responsible for maintaining order.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Faced with this situation of power vacuum, Indonesian nationalists,
                        aware of the intentions of the Allied authorities to restore the territories occupied by the Japanese to the colonial situation prior to the beginning of the conflict, and in growing opposition to the return of Dutch rule, 
                        proclaimed the independence on August 17th of 1945. The most exalted factions of the independence movement, such as the <i><strong>Pemuda</strong></i> or "Youth", gave rise to a period of progressive tension.

                        &emsp; Increasingly violent altercations made the Japanese retreat to the main population centers and strategic places.
                        At this point the Japanese reaction was uneven, sympathizers with the independence cause delivered weapons to the insurgents,
                        consisting of both light weapons and artillery or armored vehicles (such as those mentioned above), but in other cases, in compliance with the terms of the surrender,
                        they refused to do so and suffered the Indonesian attack in different detachments, mainly with the objective of achieving control of the cities and arsenals.

                        &emsp; Faced with the variety of uncontrolled militias and after the Japanese had dissolved the most disciplined PETA auxiliary groups (the Giyungun and Heiho groups),
                        the new Indonesian leaders saw it necessary to unite and organize these forces. On<strong> 22nd August 1945</strong>, the <strong>BKR (Badan Keamanan Rakjat)</strong> "People's Security Agency" was created,
                        with the objective of maintaining order. Later, when the possible clash with the allied forces became evident, that body became the <strong>TKR (Tentara Keamanan Rakjat)</strong> "People's Security Forces" on October 5th
                        1945 as the embryo of the new Indonesian armed forces intended to provide cohesion for different armed groups that began to emerge. The bulk of its officers came from the indigenous command cadres formed by the former KNIL and the majority of the troops with military training had been part of PETA.

                        &emsp; Since its inception, the TKR had three "weapons": <strong>TKR Darat</strong> (Land), <strong>TKR Laoet</strong> (Navy) and <strong>TKR Jawatan Panerbangan</strong> (Air Service).
                        Most of its components were infantry soldiers with "basic" military training and without combat experience, although highly motivated.
                        The equipment consisted of light firearms, with an undetermined number of artillery pieces and up to 25 tanks of various types and nationalities, all of which had been taken from Japanese warehouses.
                        The armored vehicles were grouped into a motorized unit but could not play a prominent role due to the lack of trained crews and mechanical personnel, as well as the necessary spare parts.

                        &emsp; Dutch, the former colonial power, was not in a position to send significant military forces until 1946, as its army was in the process of rebuilding.
                        For this reason, it was up to Great Britain to send occupation forces to the territory of the former Netherlands East Indies.
                        Its mission was to carry out the disarmament and repatriation of Japanese troops, the release of interned prisoners and the maintenance of public order, as well as to return the status quo prior to the Japanese arrival.
                        But turns out that this mission was to encounter opposition from the new authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of Indonesia.

                        &emsp; As we already mentioned, the vehicle that is the subject of our analysis was unveiled during the Battle of Surabaya.
                        This has been considered the most important and consequential combat during the Indonesian War of Independence, to the point that November 10th (the height of the battle) is celebrated today as National "Heroes Day".
                        During its course, the existence of this vehicle was learned for the first time.

                        &emsp; The new authorities of the recently self-proclaimed Republic of Indonesia considered this British presence as an interference, and with that, communicated their position as well as rejection of the return to the previous colonial status.

                        &emsp; On the other hand, the climate of violence, caused by uncontrolled groups of exalted nationalists, led the Indonesian authorities to enter into negotiations with the British, in order to limit their presence and to preserve the maintenance of public order.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The British action tried to carry out the original missions, which involved exceeding the conditions of the recent agreement with the Indonesians.
                        These breaches caused constant altercations and clashes against groups of the most extremist faction of the aforementioned, <strong>Pemuda</strong> movement. 
                        Numerous Anglo-Indian detachments found themselves attacked and isolated, to such an extent that there were fears for the integrity of the 49th Brigade.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; On October 29th, the British authorities reached a fragile ceasefire with the most conservative faction of the Indonesian republicans.
                        As the communication did not reach all positions in time, on October 30th, General Mallaby went to the position of an Anglo-Indian detachment that are still isolated to make the ceasefire effective and facilitate the subsequent evacuation,
                        when he was finally murdered in confusing circumstances. Some versions say that he died from gunshots from a militiaman at a checkpoint, others say that he died from wounds caused by a grenade thrown in a moment of tension by one of his assistants.
                        The fact is that Mallaby's death provoked the reaction of the British high command and the desire for revenge among his troops.

                        &emsp; This battle, although a defeat for the Indonesian side, strengthened their determination to resist and encouraged them to continue the fight. 
                        Since 1946, Dutch troops will take over from the British in this conflict that will end in <strong>1949</strong> with the recognition of <strong>Indonesian independence</strong>.

                        &emsp; Among the weapons abandoned by the Indonesian forces after the end of the Surabaya fighting, the British encountered the bulk of the heterogeneous Republican armored group. 
                        Apparently, these armored vehicles did not have a decisive use in combat, since there are hardly any references to their use, and there is doubt about the training of their crews for their handling and their maintenance means. 
                        What does exist is a small number of images that show us various models of captured Indonesian tanks. <strong>The picture of an Anglo-Indian soldier inspecting a Marmon-Herrington CTLS-4TAC</strong> (ex-KNIL) tank is very representative, it also shows a <strong>Type 95 Ha-Go</strong> (ex-Japanese) tank. 
                        Both were armored vehicles used by Indonesian nationalists that came from Japanese arsenals.

<hr> <!---------------------------------------------------- Characteristics ---------------------------------------------------->
                    </a>

                    <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; When describing its characteristics, some will be estimated. 
                        The Universal <strong>Carrier MK I</strong> was a highly versatile armored personnel carrier that was used in many versions. 
                        Developed in the mid-1930s by the Vickers-Armstrong firm, it was the armored personnel carrier most used by Commonwealth troops during World War II.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Just for the comparison, our tank dimensions were 3.65 m long, 2.6 m wide and an approximate height of 2.4 m (1.60 m on the original Universal Carrier). 
                        Its weight would be close to 4 ton (3.75 ton in the original UC fully loaded). 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The thickness and quality of the armor would range from 7 to 10 mm on the main body of the Universal Carrier, 
                        6 mm arranged with a 20º inclination angle of the turret (Type 91 or 93 Sumida) to unknown thickness as well as the quality of the armor plates used in the superstructure arranged at different high angles of inclination.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The armament is unknown to us, since in both available images, the armament was removed from the vanguard position of the chassis (its hole was not sealed so its use is assumed) and furthermore, we cannot see the one installed in the tower, because being turned showing the back. 
                        The possibilities are wide but I am inclined to think that it could have been fitted with a combination of the <strong>7.92 mm Bren machine gun</strong> in the hull and a <strong>6.5 mm Japanese Type 91 machine gun</strong> in the turret, or the Japanese Type 91 machine guns on both positions.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The original propulsion of the Universal Carrier was provided by a <strong>Ford V8 gasoline engine with 85 HP</strong> at 3.500 revolutions located in a central rear position. 
                        The original speed (38 km/h) and autonomy (150 km) would be reduced due to the increase in weight (approx. 200 kg) contributed by the modifications made. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The number of crew members is unknown to us. The original Universal Carrier had two crew members: the driver sat on the front right side and the machine gunner on the left side in a more advanced position. 
                        This conversion possibly had at least three crew members: driver and machine gunner in the original positions and a machine gunner/commander located in the turret. 
                        It must be assumed that the commander would perform his duties with difficulty, because in addition to the inconveniences of a single-seat turret, it was installed at a low height and distance above the location of the engine.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Accesses were added by closing the transport/combat and driving chamber. Then a rectangular hatch for the driver and hull machine gunner was incorporated on the front glacis of the superstructure. A semicircular hatch for the commander/gunner was located on the roof of the turret.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; The original Universal Carrier was conceived as an armored troop transport and infantry support and scouting vehicle. Over time, the versatility demonstrated by this platform allowed the development of a wide variety of types with different specialties (motorcycle carrier, artillery tractor, flamethrower, anti-tank... etc.) but the function of this modified vehicle is not so defined. 
                        It cannot be a transport because its combat chamber has been closed and it does not seem ideal for exploration because its mobility has been reduced due to the increase in weight. The fact that the modifications applied increased its protection and firepower and reduced its mobility, leading to the assumption that it was designed to perform "police" services of maintaining order and surveillance of strategic points and communication routes.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Who is responsible for the conversion? This is a controversial aspect. We do not have objective data that gives us a clear answer. There are three main possibilities.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; First, the Dutch authorship. The Dutch had the technical capacity and facilities (KNIL workshops or NEI/Braat factory) necessary to carry out the conversion as well as adapt to the maintenance of public order functions that at that time were mainly carried out by KNIL forces. Against this is the fact that the Dutch did not have a Universal Carrier in the Dutch East Indies until its reconstruction and re-equipment in 1946. 
                        In some forums there is the undocumented claim of the arrival of a diverted consignment of Universal Carriers in 1942 , which were originally destined for Malaya. But still no evidence of where they could have taken the turret.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Second, the Indonesian authorship. Since the proclamation of independence on August 17th 1945, Indonesian forces had been equipped with material found in Japanese arsenals and depots. We do not know their technical preparation and resources available to carry out these modifications to which the short period of time they had for their conversion.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Third, Japanese authorship. The result of this conversion responds perfectly to the Japanese need to reinforce the means that would facilitate their occupation task. They had several examples of Universal Carrier captured from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong or the Philippines and Sumida Type 91 or 93 armored vehicles. 
                        Added to this was the technical training and availability of the former Dutch facilities in Surabaya, already mentioned, now in their hands. Japanese. Speculating on my part, i think the Japanese authorship theory is the most likely to be possible.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; How many copies were manufactured? We are only sure of the example photographed during the fighting in Surabaya in 1945. The details of both photographs seem to indicate that it is the same vehicle. 
                        But Andrew Morrison in his work <i>"Making Tracks" British Carrier Story 1914 to 1972</i> states that one or two examples could have been converted because Australian troops found in New Guinea a Universal Carrier converted in a similar way by the Japanese
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Finished with the external analysis, we must not overlook the information that external labels and symbols can provide. All the armored vehicles captured from the Japanese by the Indonesian nationalists were labeled following a common pattern, although manually and "irregularly" 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; All vehicles painted the Indonesian flag in a visible place, mainly on the front and on the tower. In the case of our vehicle, the Indonesian flag was painted, consisting of a red and white stripe (like from the Dutch flag but eliminating the blue band) on the rear right side of the turret. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Another common element was the indicative of the faction to which it belonged, within the different Indonesian armed groups. In the photographs we can only see the right side of the armored vehicle, so we do not know the left side although it is very likely to be mirrored. 
                        <strong>On the right side of armored vehicle body, the initials TKRL</strong> are marked, in white and large. They are indicative of <strong><i>Tentara Keamanan Rakjat Laoet</i></strong> (Mar People's Security Forces), this is the naval group of the <strong>TKR</strong> (People's Security Forces), the "regular forces" of the Indonesian independence movement. In the photograph that shows a  front view of the vehicle, it can be seen that the turret has the initials <strong>TK... labeled in red</strong>, 
                        which apparently continues but we cannot see it. It would possibly indicate TKR or TKRL. Continuing along the turret, you can see the symbol of an <strong>anchor</strong>, labeled in white and occupying the back of the turret with more regular lines than the rest of the texts. <strong>Next to it and around it the word LAOET</strong> seems to have been added afterwards. <i>"Laoet"</i> means sea according to ancient Indonesian spelling, <i>"Laut"</i> according to current one. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; Finally, the armored vehicle has tried to be camouflaged in an "artisanal" way with a line of lines in different tones, which is clearly noticeable on the front right part but becomes confusing in the rest of the body.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; We end up concluding that the lack of documentation or direct testimonies allows us to assume rather than affirm that the vehicle analyzed above is a light tank used by the TKRL, the naval branch of the Indonesian regular army TKR. 
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; When it came to attributing its authorship, we found more reasons to assume that it was a conversion carried out by the Japanese. The Japanese used it as support in the occupation tasks and assigned it to the detachment of the Imperial Japanese Navy stationed in Surabaya, as indicated by the anchor on its tower. 
                        After the Japanese surrender it was taken by Indonesian nationalists from the Imperial Navy arsenals at Goebeng. It participated in the Surabaya combats of November 1945, where it was hit, immobilized and captured by Anglo-Indian troops.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                        &emsp; After the arrival of Dutch forces in Indonesia/Netherlands East Indies in 1946, taking over from the British, they again used all the war material seized by the British from the Indonesians that they considered useful. The fact that we do not find any mention of this original conversion leads us to assume that it was abandoned, dismantled or its modifications were reversed to be used again in its original form.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
                        I apologize for the certain errors and I will appreciate any contribution that helps us know a little more about this original conversion. I await your opinions.
                    </p>
